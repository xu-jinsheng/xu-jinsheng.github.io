<h2>Hi there, I am Xu.</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a math student at University of Bonn. I had been using https://xujinsheng.wikidots.com as my webpage. I have not migrate everything yet, and I am not planning on doing so. Hence, you can find some more about me there. </p>

<h2>I do not like texting.</h2>
<p>I appreciate the bit extra information I can get from voices and facial/body expressions, and I do not want to stare into and press on a screen all the time.<p>

<h2> I keep a very short contact list on my phone.</h2>
<p>However, I put photos, birthdays, emails, and addresses in them. In my experience, I can not remember too many people in my life, and for those people I remember, I want to remember them better. So, do not panic when I ask for your address or birthday.
</p>

<h2>I </h2>
