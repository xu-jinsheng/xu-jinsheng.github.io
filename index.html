<h2>Hi there, I am Xu.</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a math student at University of Bonn. I had been using https://xujinsheng.wikidots.com as my webpage. I have not migrate everything yet, and I am not planning on doing so. Hence, you can find some more about me there. </p>

<h2>I hate texting.</h2>
<p>I appreciate the bit extra information I can get from voices and facial/body expressions, and I do not want to stare into and swap fingers on a screen all the time. </p>

<h2>I care about the planet.</h2>
