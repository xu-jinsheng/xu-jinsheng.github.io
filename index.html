<h2>Hi there, I am Xu.</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my personal webpage. 
  I am a math student at University of Bonn. 
  You can find a bit more about me on my old webpage https://xujinsheng.wikidots.com.
</p>

<h2>Call me instead.</h2>
<p>
  The bit extra information from voices and facial expressions means a lot to me. 
  Screens makes me moody, and are avoided when possible, which means I miss text messages. 
  Hence, call me instead. 
  I must have given you my number before. 
  If not, feel free to ask. 
<p>

<h2>My contact list is short.</h2>
<p>
  However, I put birthdays, emails, addresses and even photos in them. 
  I can not remember too many people. 
  For those people I want to remember, I want to remember them better. 
  Therefore, do not panic when I ask for your address or birthday or email. 
  I do not ask everyone for those.
</p>
