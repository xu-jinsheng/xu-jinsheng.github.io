<h2>Hi there, I am Xu.</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a math student at University of Bonn. I had been using https://xujinsheng.wikidots.com as my webpage. I have not migrate everything yet, and I am not planning on doing so. Hence, you can find some more about me there. </p>

<h2>Call me instead.</h2>
<p>The bit extra information from voices and facial expressions means a lot to me, and screens make my days suck, and are avoided if possible. This means I miss text messages all the time. Hence, call me instead. I must have given you my number before. If not, feel free to ask. <p>

<h2>My contact list is short.</h2>
<p>However, I put birthdays, emails, addresses and even photos in them. I can not remember too many people. For those people I want to remember, I want to remember them better. Therefore, do not panic when I ask for your address or birthday or email. I do not ask everyone for those.
</p>

<h2>I </h2>
